# IDCheck.io Mobile SDK Sample

## Getting Started

To get this sample running, please follow the instructions :

 1. Ask our [Customer Success Managers](mailto:csm@ariadnext.com) for credentials to access the *ARIADNEXT* external repository in order to retrieve the **IDCheck.io Mobile SDK** library and integrate it to the project (update the **build.gradle** at the root of the project):

    ```groovy
    // TODO 1: Set your own credentials to access ARIADNEXT external repository in order to access SDK library download
    maven {
        credentials {
            username = "<YOUR USERNAME>"
            password = "<YOUR PASSWORD>"
        }
        url "https://repoman.rennes.ariadnext.com/content/repositories/com.ariadnext.idcheckio/"
    }
    ```

 2. With your application bundle id, ask the [Customer Success Managers](mailto:csm@ariadnext.com) to create an `idToken` to activate the SDK. You can then integrate it in your project using a `buildConfigField` in your **app/build.gradle** file:

    ```groovy
    // TODO 2: Set your own IdCheck.io token
    buildConfigField 'String', 'IDCHECKIO_ID_TOKEN', "\"YOUR_ID_TOKEN\""
    ```

## Sample application

This sample project aims to showcase all possibilities of the **IDCheck.io Mobile SDK** and the associated best practices regarding these features. It also helps you understand how you can easily integrate the SDK, activate it and customise/adapt it to your application and business needs.

The main screen displays a sliding tile to choose between four distinct capture flows :

 - **Online flow** : this flow uses the SDK for capturing an ID document first, and then continues with a Biometric Liveness session capture. It shows what you need to do in order to chain multiple online captures and keep transferring the *OnlineContext* through all these captures.
 - **Simple capture** : this flow has a specific selector to show you how to setup the SDK in order to capture a specific document (from ID to address proof, or even selfie).
 - **IPS session** : Specific capture session that will handle ID + Biometric Liveness capture in the most secure way (PVID certified).
 - **Analyze** : this flow uses the `Idcheckio.analyze` API which is useful when you don't want to use the camera feed for live-capturing and analyzing a document, but instead use a static image provided by the user from his phone's gallery.

Select the flow you want to try, and click on *Give it a try* button to start capturing documents with the SDK.
